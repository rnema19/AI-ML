RAG - is used for better output of the prompt. There are many answers relevant to the given prompt
but RAG is used to generate the most probable and suitable answers.
A RAG pipeline explores the best words matching to its knowledge base.

Finetuning - Finetuning is used when we want to train our model in a specific domain.
Suppose in health related agent, a finetuned model in health information would give better results
related to health related questions than a normal agent

This would result in more token usage in that sector, more requests and lesser 
efficiency in other domain knowledge of the same model.

We use RAG when we want to build an agent to carry out tasks, retrieve general information
and automate processes.
